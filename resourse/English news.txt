The U.S. National Weather Service (NWS) on Monday issued warnings for severe thunderstorms across Southwest California through Tuesday.
The weather agency said there is an increased risk of strong to severe thunderstorms across Southwest California through Tuesday morning, capable of producing damaging wind gusts of up to 60 mph (27 m/s), brief heavy downpours and small hail.
Conditions are favorable for rotating storms that could generate isolated tornadoes, the NWS said on the social media platform X.
A band of rain and thunderstorms is expected to persist along a cold front into Tuesday morning, extending well offshore, the agency said, warning that an isolated tornado and localized wind damage will remain possible along the Southern California coast through midday Tuesday.
Residents are urged to take precautions, seek sturdy shelter away from windows during strong winds, avoid driving on roads near recent wildfire burn scars, and stay alert for potential urban flooding and canyon rockslides.
