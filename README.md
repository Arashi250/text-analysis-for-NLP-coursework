# Text Analysis for NLP Coursework

## Project Description
This project explores fundamental natural language processing (NLP) tasks on both Chinese and English texts. 
It focuses on text segmentation, part-of-speech tagging, syntactic parsing, and semantic role labeling, providing a hands-on comparison of different tools and methods.  
本项目探索了中英文文本的自然语言处理基础任务，包括分词、词性标注、句法分析和语义角色标注，旨在通过实践比较不同工具和方法的效果。

## Features

### 1. Chinese Word Segmentation & POS Tagging
- **Corpus**: Three types of Chinese texts (news, novel, poetry)  
- **Tools**: Jieba, THULAC, SnowNLP  
- **Goal**: Perform word segmentation and part-of-speech tagging; conduct qualitative and quantitative comparison of the results.

### 2. Syntactic Analysis
- **Chinese Syntax Parser**: LTP  
- **English Syntax Parser**: spaCy  
- **Goal**: Perform syntactic parsing on selected Chinese and English corpora and analyze sentence structures.

### 3. Advanced Functional Exploration
- Semantic Role Labeling (SRL)  
- Semantic Dependency arsing  
- Multi-task exploration of text features and relations  

## Output
- Chinese segmentation results (word list + POS)
- Syntactic trees for Chinese and English sentences
- Semantic role labeling (predicate -> arguments)
- All outputs saved in structured text files under syntax_results/ and srl_results/
